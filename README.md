# trailrunners
## Introduction
In this repository we are exploring the performance of various Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architechtures, neuron models, and training algorithms
on trail-running tasks proposed by John R. Koza et. al.

A playable version of the trail simulation can be found at [danielkm-ee/trail-task](https://github.com/danielkm-ee/trail-task.git), built using the PyGame library.

## Requirements
Libraries used for the project include
- PyTorch
- snnTorch
- PyGame
